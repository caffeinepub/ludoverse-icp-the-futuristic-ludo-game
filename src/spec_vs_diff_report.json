  "summary": "The implementation addresses automatic Internet Identity authentication flow with partial coverage. Core authentication restoration (REQ-81, REQ-82) is implemented in App.tsx with automatic delegation checking and silent login. Error handling (REQ-85) is present with toast notifications. Header updates (REQ-86) properly hide login button when authenticated. However, the critical useInternetIdentity.ts hook modifications are not visible in the diff, making it impossible to verify delegation validation logic (REQ-83) and automatic refresh implementation (REQ-84).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-83",
      "requirement": "Fix delegation validation logic in useInternetIdentity.ts to properly verify delegation expiry and chain validation. Ensure expired or invalid delegations are detected and cleared, triggering re-authentication only when necessary.",
      "reason": "The useInternetIdentity.ts hook file is not included in the diff. Cannot verify delegation expiry validation, chain validation logic, or clearing of expired delegations.",
      "evidence": []

    {
      "id": "REQ-84",
      "requirement": "Implement automatic delegation refresh in useInternetIdentity.ts that renews delegations before they expire. Set up a timer to refresh delegations proactively, maintaining seamless authenticated sessions without interruption.",
      "reason": "The useInternetIdentity.ts hook file is not included in the diff. Cannot verify delegation refresh timer implementation, proactive renewal logic, or refresh failure handling.",
