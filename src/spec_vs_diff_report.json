  "summary": "The diff implements most modular game mode requirements including backend GameMode enum extensions, RankedStatus support, frontend mode selection UI, and mode-specific board rendering. However, several critical requirements are missing or only partially implemented: backend game mode logic (Classic/Quick/Master rules), turn timer auto-skip functionality, Master Mode dice choice backend logic, and mobile optimization verification.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-37",
      "requirement": "Implement Classic Mode backend rules in main.mo: traditional Ludo rules with support for 2-4 players, no power-ups, and separate ranked/unranked tracking. Store match results with mode-specific statistics.",
      "reason": "Backend main.mo shows GameMode enum and RankedStatus fields added to GameSession, but no evidence of Classic Mode-specific game logic implementation (movement rules, capture rules, power-up exclusion logic, mode-specific statistics storage)",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-38",
      "requirement": "Implement Quick Mode backend rules in main.mo: shortened board paths (reduce path length by 30-40%), faster dice mechanics (allow extra rolls on 6s with shorter cooldown), and time-limited turns (30-45 second turn timer). Support 2-4 players with no power-ups and ranked/unranked variants.",
      "reason": "Backend shows no implementation of Quick Mode logic. Frontend GameBoard.tsx has path length constants (QUICK_MODE_PATH_LENGTH = 35), but backend main.mo lacks Quick Mode-specific rules, dice cooldown logic, or turn timer enforcement. Auto-skip logic for timer expiration is not implemented in backend.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-39",
      "requirement": "Implement Master Mode backend rules in main.mo: skill-heavy gameplay with dice choice options. Allow players to choose between multiple dice values or dice roll modifiers on their turn. Include advanced move validation and strategic gameplay mechanics.",
      "reason": "Backend main.mo shows no Master Mode logic implementation. Frontend GameBoard.tsx shows dice choice UI (6 clickable options), but backend lacks dice choice system, deterministic selection logic, or advanced move validation for Master Mode.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo",
        "frontend/src/components/GameBoard.tsx"

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-41",
      "requirement": "Turn timer auto-advances turn when time expires in Quick Mode",
      "reason": "Frontend GameBoard.tsx displays countdown timer UI for Quick Mode (45 seconds), but there is no evidence of auto-advance functionality in either frontend timer logic or backend turn management when timer expires",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/GameBoard.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-43",
      "requirement": "Optimize Quick Mode UI and controls in GameBoard.tsx for mobile devices. Ensure touch interactions are responsive, dice rolls are instant, and the turn timer is prominently displayed. Test on mobile viewports to ensure the shortened board and faster gameplay work smoothly on smaller screens.",
      "reason": "While index.css shows mobile-optimized touch controls with 44px minimum touch targets, there is no evidence of Quick Mode-specific mobile testing, touch interaction verification, or performance optimization for mobile viewports in the diff. The requirement explicitly requires testing on mobile viewports (320px-768px).",
