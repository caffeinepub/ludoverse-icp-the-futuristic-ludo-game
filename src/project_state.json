Phase 1 (complete) delivered core visual and UX upgrades including 3D board, physics-based dice, 3D tokens, and smooth animations. Phase 2 focuses on implementing modular game modes: Classic Mode (traditional rules, 2-4 players, ranked/unranked), Quick Mode (shortened paths, faster dice, time-limited turns for mobile), and Master Mode (skill-heavy with dice choice options). Future phases will add Magic Mode, real-time multiplayer, ICP betting, and Web3 features.",
