  "summary": "LudoVerse - An advanced, premium multiplayer Ludo game with original assets, colorful casino-style UI, and multiple game modes. Phase 1 (complete) delivered core visual and UX upgrades including 3D board, physics-based dice, 3D tokens, and smooth animations. Phase 2 (complete) implemented modular game modes: Classic Mode (traditional rules, 2-4 players, ranked/unranked), Quick Mode (shortened paths, faster dice, time-limited turns for mobile), and Master Mode (skill-heavy with dice choice options). Phase 3 focuses on real-time multiplayer infrastructure with room-based matchmaking, private/public rooms, server-authoritative dice, reconnect support, and spectator-ready architecture using WebSockets, state sync with rollback safety, and deterministic dice seeds. Phase 4 will add real ICP blockchain integration with betting, wallets, escrow, prize pool, provably fair dice, and mandatory demo mode. Future phases will add Magic Mode and Web3 features.",
